This package contains the source code for xllmnrd.

xllmnrd is an IPv6 LLMNR responder daemon for GNU/Linux operating systems.  It
allows Microsoft Windows clients to get the IPv6 address of a GNU/Linux server
on the same local network _without any DNS configuration_ and thereby
effectively complements Samba which provides NetBIOS name resolution for IPv4.

xllmnrd is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  You should have received a copy of
it as the 'COPYING' file.

# Installation

For generic installation instructions, read the 'INSTALL' file.  If you are
also planning to run the included test suite with GCC, you might have to set
the environment variable 'CXX' to 'g++ -std=gnu++11' (or to 'g++ -std=gnu++0x'
depending on the compiler version) before you run 'configure'.

If you find any other problem while installation, please report it to our
[issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/kazssym/xllmnrd/issues).
