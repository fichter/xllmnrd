This directory contains the source code for an experimental IPv6 LLMNR
responder for GNU/Linux operating systems.  It makes it possible for Microsoft
Windows clients to get the IPv6 addresses of local GNU/Linux servers without
any DNS configuration.  It is intended to be used on an unmanaged small/home
network to improve interoperability between GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows.
