# Version 1.0y1

This release is the first milestone for version 1.0.0.

## New features

* It now joins the LLMNR multicast group automatically for each network interface that has a link-scope IPv6 address.

## Known limitations

* It _does not_ respond yet but logs each received query via syslog.
  This feature is planned in the next milestone.
